## Getting started
1. Clone this github repo
2. Install dbt following [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation)
3. Ask your database administrator for a set of snowflake credentials.


  The database administrator should run the following statements from a super user account to create your account.
```sql
create user <user>
    password = '<generate_this>'
    default_warehouse = transforming
    default_role = transformer;
```

4. Copy the example profile to your `~/.dbt` folder (created when installing dbt):
```bash
$ cp ./sample.profiles.yml ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
```
5. Populate `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` with the credentials you obtained in step 3:
```bash
open ~/.dbt
```
6. Verify that you can connect to your database
```
$ dbt debug
```
7. Verify that you can run dbt
```
$ dbt run
```
